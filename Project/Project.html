        <p>Sandeep Maheshwari is a name among millions who struggled, failed and surged ahead
            in search of success,
            happiness and contentment. Just like any middle class guy, he too had a bunch of unclear dreams and a
            blurred
            vision of his goals in life. All he had was an undying learning attitude to hold on to. Rowing through ups
            and
            downs, it was time that taught him the true meaning of his life.And once discovered, he consistently kept
            resigning from his comfort zone and to share the secret of his success with the entire world. It is this
            very
            urge of helping people and doing something good for the society that inspired him to take the initiative of
            changing people's lives in the form of "Free Life-Changing Seminars and Sessions".

            No wonder people connect with him and his mission of 'Sharing' is now being actively propagated and
            practiced by
            millions. It is his diligent focus, the great support of his family and the faith of his team that keeps him
            going. <a href="https://www.sandeepmaheshwari.com/thePerson.aspx" target="block">
